Summary of the insights
--
𝐒𝐮𝐩𝐩𝐥𝐲 𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐢𝐧:The average shipping delay has been consistently increasing by approximately one hour per year. The percentage of late delivery risk is critically high, contributing to a 22.76% decline in order item quantity in 2017.

𝐂𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐫 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭: Out of 11 departments 6 departments are in loses and only remaining 5 of them are profitable, customers were increased to 48.27% percent from 2016 to 2017.

𝐒𝐡𝐢𝐩𝐩𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐄𝐟𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲: The average shipping delay is around 15 hours, which may have contributed to the decline in order quantity observed in 2017.

𝐌𝐚𝐩: The primary markets are located in North and South America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific regions.

𝐒𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐬 The majority of profits are generated from regular consumers and corporate clients.

Recommendations
--
- To address the high percentage of late shipments, I recommend gathering insights from the supply chain team and analyzing any issues that might be causing delays or other delivery problems.
- out of 11 departments 6 are in loses, i would recommend doing a financial analysis to identify key inefficiency and also try to implent any cost cutting measures if possible to remain profitable in those departments.
